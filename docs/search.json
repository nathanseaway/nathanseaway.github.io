The first photo was taken in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica on a hiking trip, the second paddle boarding in Santa Barbara, the third & fourth rock climbing and whale watching in Alaska.\nA bit more about me:\nI am a soon to be graduate of the University of California Santa Barbara, with a B.S. in Environmental Studies (as well as a minor in French). During my studies I have focused on course work related to ecology, restoration, and botany. I have a passion for plants as well as conservation, and I have completed various internships related to plant restoration as well as plant phenology.\nGoing forward, I hope to find a job in conservation biology, restoration ecology, or a related field. After that I hope to go to graduate school for botany or plant ecology.\nIn my free time, I love to get outside! I enjoy surfing, hiking, swimming, kayaking, backpacking, and biking. Check out the tab on surfing and hiking if you want to learn more."
