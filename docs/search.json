    "text": "Surfing\nI only got into surfing recently, but some of my best memories has been out on the waves! I am still a complete novice, but I try to go out and surf at least a couple times each week. My favorite spots include Devreux, Campus Point, and Rincon – all in Santa Barbara County. I am mostly into long boarding, but have occasionally short boarded. I feel like surfing can be such a beautiful and spiritual experience, one that allows me to connect with the ocean. In the future I hope to explore more spots to surf around the State and even around the world! I don’t have any photos of myself surfing, but hopefully I will soon!"

    "text": "My most recent Internship has focused on collecting and analyzing phenology data on plants at the UCSB Lagoon, for the Cheadle Center. My work consists of monitoring eight different plots on the Lagoon Island, and assessing all the flowering plants in those plots on how far along they are in their bloom cycle. I collect data weekly, and have created graphs using R of several of the more common native species found there, to compare how blooming differs by year. This work is part of a larger project aimed at determining the feeding habits of native bee species; my work aims to help to determine resource availability for bees over time.\nThe map below displays the eight different plots where I collect data. Each marker represents a different part of the island/plot where I walk a transect and collect information on the surronding plants’ phenology. Plots are either labeled a year or as “unburned”. Each year label represents the year in which this plot last had a prescribed burn, and unburned simply means this area never has been burned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are a few of the figures I have created using R to display bloom cycles for different flowering species to compare year to year. Each species in each plot has been given a ranking, 1-5, each week during its bloom cycle to roughly assess how far along it is. 1 represents just beginning to bloom, 3 means peak bloom, and 5 means last flowers still blooming. The graphs below aggregate data across plots to create figures that assess the species as a whole."

    "text": "A Beach near Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica, I visisted while backpacking there last summer. It was so amazing getting to see such beatiful landscapes and diverse nature; also the best beaches ever! Costa Rica might be my favorite place in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I am stand up paddle boarding with my friend Emma near campus point (even though I was sitting). There were so many brown pelicans, which are also an awesome success story of the Endangered Species Act!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the tail of a Hump Back Whale I saw while in Juneau, Alaska with my family.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is me belaying down a rockface. Moments earlier I had slipped and hit my head on the rock. Ouch. Still a really fun memory though.\n\n\n\nHi there!\nHere are a few photos I’ve taken from various trips that I think are super cool. The first photo was taken in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica on a hiking trip, the second paddle boarding in Santa Barbara, the third & fourth rock climbing and whale watching in Alaska.\nA bit more about me:\nI am a soon to be graduate of the University of California Santa Barbara, with a B.S. in Environmental Studies (as well as a minor in French). During my studies I have focused on course work related to ecology, restoration, and botany. I have a passion for plants as well as conservation, and I have completed various internships related to plant restoration as well as plant phenology.\nMy two most recent internships have been with the UCSB Cheadle Center. There I have completed an internship in restoration at the campus lagoon where I gained experience in transect monitoring, restoration techniques, and greenhouse work. My most recent internship has been collecting and analyzing phenology data related to plants at the lagoon. To explore more about this please see the projects tab.\nGoing forward, I hope to find a job in conservation biology, restoration ecology, or a related field. After that I hope to go to graduate school for botany or plant ecology.\nIn my free time, I love to get outside! I enjoy surfing, hiking, swimming, kayaking, backpacking, and biking. Check out the tab on surfing and hiking if you want to learn more."

It is a detailed hypothetical plan for the restoration of the grassland of More Mesa in Santa Barbara, Ca.\nThe full report covers the steps necessary to convert this site, dominated by invasive grasses, to a native perennial grassland ecosystem. Includes detailed analysis of site background and surveying, restoration methods, monitoring, budgeting, as well as permitting.\n View Full Restoration Management Plan (PDF)"
