## Hikes

I love to hike, and I believe it is one of the best ways to get in touch with nature while having fun! I am partial to any hike where I can get in the water or see widlife. Some of my all time favorites has been exploring the national parks of Costa Rica where I saw several types of monkeys, agoutis, camens, crocodiles, and so many different bird species. In Santa Barbara, one of my favorite memories was hiking the back country with my friends. It was so fun to traverse this often difficult hardly frequented terrain, explore nature, and jump in parts of the river!

##  Surfing

I only got into surfing recently, but some of my best memories has been out on the waves! I am still a complete novice, but I try to go out and surf at least a couple times each week. My favorite spots include Devreux, Campus Point, and Rincon â€“ all in Santa Barbara County. I am mostly into long boarding, but have occasionally short boarded. I feel like surfing can be such a beautiful and spiritual experience, one that allows me to connect with the ocean. In the future I hope to explore more spots to surf around the State and even around the world! I don't have any photos of myself surfing, but hopefully I will soon!
