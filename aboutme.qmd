Hi there!

Here are a few photos I've taken from various trips that I think are super cool. The first photo was taken in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica on a hiking trip, the second paddle boarding in Santa Barbara, the third & fourth rock climbing and whale watching in Alaska.

A bit more about me:

I am a soon to be graduate of the University of California Santa Barbara, with a B.S. in Environmental Studies (as well as a minor in French). During my studies I have focused on course work related to ecology, restoration, and botany. I have a passion for plants as well as conservation, and I have completed various internships related to plant restoration as well as plant phenology.

My two most recent internships have been with the UCSB Cheadle Center. There I have completed an internship in restoration at the campus lagoon where I gained experience in transect monitoring, restoration techniques, and greenhouse work. My most recent internship has been collecting and analyzing phenology data related to plants at the lagoon. To explore more about this please see the projects tab.

Going forward, I hope to find a job in conservation biology, restoration ecology, or a related field. After that I hope to go to graduate school for botany or plant ecology.

In my free time, I love to get outside! I enjoy surfing, hiking, swimming, kayaking, backpacking, and biking. Check out the tab on surfing and hiking if you want to learn more.
