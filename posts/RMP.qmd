This mock restoration management plan was part of a group project I worked on for a class called Foundation of Ecosystem Restoration. It is a detailed hypothetical plan for the restoration of the grassland of More Mesa in Santa Barbara, Ca.

The full report covers the steps necessary to convert this site, dominated by invasive grasses, to a native perennial grassland ecosystem. Includes detailed analysis of site background and surveying, restoration methods, monitoring, budgeting, as well as permitting.
